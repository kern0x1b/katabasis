# deps.sh [OUT] -- reproduce the lifter's dependency tree from scratch: clone rellume and its
# subprojects at the commits deps/patches/*-base-commit.txt pin, apply deps/patches/*.patch on top
# in the order listed there, and build librellume.dylib. OUT defaults to $LAB/deps, the checkout
# every worktree's `deps` symlink (or, after this commit, a `deps/` holding real symlinks to it plus
# a real, tracked `deps/patches/`) points at; a fresh, empty OUT reproduces the whole tree this band's
# patches are checked against, which is the point -- deps/ itself is gitignored (a fetched build
# dependency, not source), only deps/patches/ is tracked.
#
# xlate/CMakeLists.txt's RELLUME_DIR defaults to ../deps/rellume but honors -DRELLUME_DIR on the
# command line, so a clean-room build against OUT (not the shared checkout) is:
#   cmake -B /tmp/xlate-check -DRELLUME_DIR=$OUT/rellume -DLLVM_DIR=... -DClang_DIR=... xlate
#   cmake --build /tmp/xlate-check --target xlate xlgen
