# check.sh — a guest image that defines a name a host library also has (NSString, getpid) answers a bind only when
# the bind names that image: the superclass pointer, a class reference and a call stub, each. Two images that share
# a file name are told apart by install name, two with one install name are refused, and a guest image stands for a
# system library only where --replaces says so. Needs xlate/build.
